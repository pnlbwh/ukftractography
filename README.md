UKF TRACTOGRAPHY
================


About   
-----

We present a framework which uses an unscented Kalman filter for performing
tractography. At each point on the fiber the most consistent direction is found
as a mixture of previous estimates and of the local model.

It is very easy to expand the framework and to implement new fiber representations 
for it. Currently it is possible to tract fibers using two different 1-, 2-, or 3-tensor 
methods. Both methods use a mixture of Gaussian tensors. One limits the diffusion 
ellipsoids to a cylindrical shape (the second and third eigenvalue are assumed to be 
identical) and the other one uses a full tensor representation.

Installation
------------


### 1. From Source

Checkout from github:

    git clone git://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography.git

There are 3 ways to build this project from source, as a stand alone
superbuild, against a Slicer 4 build, and as a Slicer 4 extension build (which
is more of a test than anything).


#### a) Standalone Superbuild

**To use previous version of unscented Kalman filter rename unscented_kalman_filter_previous.cc to unscented_kalman_filter.cc **

    cd <build-dir>
    cmake <path-to-source>
    make
    make test

#### b) Build with Slicer4

    cd <build-dir>
    cmake -DSlicer_DIR=<path-to-Slicer4-Superbuild>/Slicer-build <path-to-source>
    make
    make test

#### c) Build via Slicer ExtensionIndex build

Create local extension index following [these instructions](https://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Build_ExtensionsIndex), containing at least `UKFTractography.s4ext` and `Eigen.s4ext` (required dependency).

It may be helpful to [test the exension upload](https://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Build_ExtensionsIndex#Extension_build.2C_test.2C_package_and_upload_using_.60ExperimentalUpload.60_target) using your API key.

### 2. As a Slicer 4 Extension

Navigate to the Slicer Extension Manager and download `UKF Tractography` to
install it as a Slicer 4 module.


Basic Usage
-----------

### 1. As Command Line Module

The executable will be called 'UKFTractography', and can be found in the bin directory
of your build folder. 

In order to see all options run.

    ./UKFTractography --help 

In the source directory of the project you will find a shell script called 'sample_run.sh'
It should give you an idea of what a function call could look like. 

Files dataset_Mask.nrrd and seeds_full_cc.nrrd in Input folder are mask and seed files of subject 100307
in hcp dataset, download the subject's preprocessed diffusion MRI data from https://db.humanconnectome.org/ 

### 2. As Slicer 4 module

Navigate to the Slicer Extension Manager and download `UKF Tractography` to
install it as a Slicer 4 module.  There will be 3 modules under
`Diffusion-->Tractography`: `UKF Tractography`, `vtk2mask`, and `vtkFilter`.


Notes
-----

On a Mac, there are rounding errors that affect the accuracy of 2T FW tracts.
This explains why the 2T_FW ctest fails.

Several steps in the SuperBuild process download additional git repositories as CMake external projects. By default `UKFTractography_USE_GIT_PROTOCOL:BOOL=OFF` indicates to use `https://` instead of `git://`. This default should work behind most firewalls (the git protocol uses port 9418: if this is blocked by your firewall the build will fail). If download problems are encountered, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography/issues/new).
