 * \section Introduction
 * \par
 * The C++ module for Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) Tractography enables the user
 * to easily perform multi-tensor filtered tractography on diffusion weighted MR images.
 * \par
 * The model is highly customizable. one-, two-, and three-tensor models are available
 * with, and without free water estimation. In addition, a 'full tensor model' representation
 * is available, where each of the eigenvalues is modeled sperately.
 * The UKF can be run constrained with Quadratic Programming or unconstrained.
 * \par
 * The code can be easily compiled as described below, and can be run either from command line
 * or as Slicer 3 or 4 module.
 *
 * \section Building
 *
 * In order to build make a new directory outside of the source tree called for
 * example ukf-build.
 *
 * There are 3 ways to build the project
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *  <b>Standalone:</b> From your build directory run the following commands
 *  \code
 *    cmake <path-to-source>/SuperBuild
 *    make
 *  \endcode
 *  This will download all resources and build the project for you.\n
 *  Note: cmake >= 2.8.4, git, and svn are required for this
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  <b>Build with Slicer:</b> To build against one of the slicer versions run
 *  <ol type='a'>
 *    <li> Slicer 3
 *       \code
 *         cmake -DSlicer3_DIR=<path-to-slicer3>/Slicer3-build <path-to-source>
 *         make
 *       \endcode
 *     </li>
 *    <li> Slicer 4
 *      \code
 *        cmake -DSlicer_DIR=<path-to-slicer4>/Slicer-build <path-to-source>
 *        make
 *      \endcode
 *    </li>
 *  </ol>
 *  Note: cmake >= 2.6, and an installed version of boost >1.41.1 is required
 *  Also, you must have a Slicer build. Only, executables are not enough.
 * </li>
 * <li> <b>Manual Build:</b> You can take care of all dependancies yourself, the easiest
 *    way to do this is using ccmake. Run ccmake from your build directory
 *    \code ccmake <path-to-source> \endcode
 *    Provide the Links to the builds of ITK, Teem, GenerateCLP, and Boost
 *    \code make \endcode
 *    Note: This is only recommended if the above two methods failed for some reason
 * </li>
 *
 * \section Running
 * \par
 * <ol>
 *   <li> <b>As Command Line Module: </b></li>
 *   The executable will be called 'UKFTractography', and can be found in the bin directory
 *   of your build folder.
 *   <br>
 *   In order to see all options run.
 *   \code
 *     ./UKFTractography --help
 *   \endcode
 *   In the source directory of the project you will find a shell script called 'sample_run.sh'
 *   It should give you an idea of what a function call could look like.
 * <li> <b>As Slicer 3 or 4 module: </b></li>
 *   Open Slicer and in the settings add the '<path-to-build>/bin' directory. When you restart
 *   Slicer the module will be under Diffusion->Tractography.
 * </ol>

 * \section Dependencies
 * \par Boost
 * The Boost C++ Libraries are a collection of free libraries that extend the functionality of C++. In this project boost is used for multithreading, and the progress bar.
 * \par teem
 * Teem is a coordinated group of libraries for representing, processing, and visualising scientific raster data. We use it to read, and process
 * The input data of type NRRD.
 * \par ITK
 * Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).  ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers
 * with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis. In this application we only use the underlying vnl libraries for most of the linear algebra processing.
 * It replaces functionality that was done with LAPACK before.
 * \par "Slicer Execution Model"
 * The Execution Model provides a simple mechanism for incorporating command line programs as Slicer modules. These command line modules
 * are self-describing, emitting an XML description of its command line arguments. Slicer uses this XML description to construct a GUI for the module. We use it to make our application
 * into a Command Line Module that can be run from Slicer, or from a Consolse without being dependand on Slicer.
